# Bank Management System

## Overview
The Bank Management System is a console-based application developed in C++ to manage bank accounts. The system allows users to create accounts, deposit and withdraw funds, modify account details, and view account information. This project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming concepts in C++ and file handling for data persistence.

## Features
**Create Account:** Add a new account with details such as account number, holder's name, account type (Savings/Current), and initial deposit.
**Deposit Amount:** Allow users to deposit money into their accounts.
**Withdraw Amount**  Allow users to withdraw money from their accounts, with balance checks to prevent overdrafts.
**Balance Enquiry:** Display account details including balance.
**Modify Account:** Update account holder details.
**Delete Account:** Remove an account from the system.
**Display All Accounts:** Show a list of all account holders and their details.
